how to play the game:

so this is a classic tic-tac-toe game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid one player uses "x" and the other uses "o" your goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row it can be horizontally vertically or diagonally

how to start:

just click one of the buttons to select if you're playing against another person or against the ai
after that the grid will appear and player 1 (x) goes first
the gameplay:

on your turn click on an empty square to place your mark (x or o)
the game automatically switches turns between the two players
if you're playing against the ai it'll try to block your moves or win when it can
once someone gets three in a row the game will announce the winner or it'll tell you if it's a tie (a "velha" or "draw" happens when the grid is full and no one has won)
resetting the game:

after the winner is declared or it's a tie the game will reset the board so you can play again
the score gets updated every time someone wins
